As the series prepares to close its chapter, Netflix looks back at the extraordinary success that made Hawkins, Indiana, and the Upside Down household names around the world.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, *Stranger Things* has become a cultural phenomenon and one of Netflix’s flagship originals. Across four groundbreaking seasons, the series has accumulated more than **`r scales::comma(total_hours)` hours of global viewership**, securing its place among the most-watched English-language shows on the platform. These numbers reflect not just statistics, but years of thrilling storytelling enjoyed by millions of fans across continents.\n\nWhat sets *Stranger Things* apart is its ability to hold audience attention over time. The series has remained in the **Top 10 for more than `r weeks_in_top10` weeks**, demonstrating a remarkable staying power that few titles can match. Week after week, season after season, the adventures of Eleven and her friends have kept viewers eagerly returning.\n\nThe show’s reach has also been distinctly international. Appearing in the Top 10 across **`r st_countries` countries**, *Stranger Things* has proven that a story born in small-town America resonates with audiences from Buenos Aires to Berlin, from Seoul to Sydney. This global impact underscores Netflix’s mission to deliver entertainment without borders.\n\nWhen compared to other top English-language TV series, *Stranger Things* consistently ranks near the top in total hours viewed. While acclaimed titles such as `r top_english_tv$show_title[2]` and `r top_english_tv$show_title[3]` have drawn large audiences, *Stranger Things* continues to outpace many of its peers, highlighting its singular role as a genre-defining show that blends supernatural thrills with heartfelt nostalgia.\n\nAs the final season approaches, Netflix is excited to deliver a powerful conclusion to this global success story. With its unique mix of suspense, 1980s nostalgia, and unforgettable characters, *Stranger Things* is ready to leave an indelible mark on television history one last time.\n\n```{r}\n# Stranger Things trend\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nst_data <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 %>%\n  filter(grepl(\"Stranger Things\", show_title)) %>%\n  group_by(week) %>%\n  summarise(weekly_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nggplot(st_data, aes(x = week, y = weekly_hours/1e6)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#e50914\", size = 1.2) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#e50914\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Stranger Things Global Viewership Trend\",\n    x = \"Week\",\n    y = \"Weekly Hours Viewed (Millions)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n```{r}\n# India data preparation\nindia_top <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 %>%\n  filter(country_name == \"India\")\n\nindia_hours <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 %>%\n  filter(show_title %in% india_top$show_title) %>%\n  summarise(total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  pull(total_hours)\n\nindia_shows <- n_distinct(india_top$show_title)\n\nus_top <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 %>%\n  filter(country_name == \"United States\")\n\nindia_unique <- setdiff(india_top$show_title, us_top$show_title)\n # hit program\n \nindia_hours\nindia_shows\nhead(india_unique, 10)\n\n```\n\n## Press Release 2: Netflix’s Blockbuster Growth in India\n\n### Netflix Celebrates Record-Breaking Hindi Hits and Rapid Subscriber Growth in the World’s Largest Market\n\nIndia, the world’s most populous nation, has become one of Netflix’s fastest-growing regions. With the surge of high-quality Hindi-language films and TV series, Netflix has established itself as a premier destination for Indian entertainment.\n\nOver the past year, Hindi titles available on Netflix have generated more than **`r scales::comma(india_hours)` hours of global viewing**, showcasing the extraordinary appetite of Indian audiences for local-language content. In total, Indian subscribers have pushed **`r india_shows` unique shows and films** into the weekly Top 10 rankings.\n\nWhat sets India apart is the strength of titles that resonate specifically with local viewers. Shows such as *`r india_unique[1]`* and *`r india_unique[2]`* have dominated the Top 10 in India even when they did not chart in the United States. This highlights Netflix’s ability to foster regional hits that speak directly to Indian culture and tastes.\n\nTaken together, these viewing patterns suggest rapid subscriber growth in India. If Hindi-language viewership is treated as a proxy for the size of the Indian customer base, Netflix is now engaging millions of households across the country—making India one of the platform’s most dynamic growth markets.\n\nLooking ahead, Netflix will continue to invest in Hindi-language originals and expand its partnerships with Indian storytellers. By delivering compelling local hits alongside global blockbusters, Netflix is committed to ensuring that Indian audiences feel at home on the world’s leading streaming platform.\n\n```{r}\n# Top 10 Netflix shows in India by number of weeks in Top 10\nindia_top10 <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 %>%\n  filter(country_name == \"India\") %>%\n  group_by(show_title) %>%\n  summarise(weeks_in_top10 = n_distinct(week)) %>%\n  arrange(desc(weeks_in_top10)) %>%\n  slice(1:10)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(\n  india_top10,                                    \n  aes(x = reorder(show_title, weeks_in_top10),   \n      y = weeks_in_top10)\n) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#E50914\") +\n  coord_flip() +                                 \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Top 10 Netflix Shows in India by Weeks in Top 10\",\n    x = \"Show Title\",\n    y = \"Weeks in Top 10\"\n  )\n```\n\n```{r}\n# Non-English TV shows in GLOBAL dataset\nnon_english_tv <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 %>%\n  filter(category == \"TV (Non-English)\")\n\n# total hour\nnon_eng_hours <- non_english_tv %>%\n  summarise(total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%\n  pull(total_hours)\n\n# TV amount\nnon_eng_shows <- n_distinct(non_english_tv$show_title)\n\n# hit non-english tv shows\ntop_non_eng <- non_english_tv %>%\n  group_by(show_title) %>%\n  summarise(total_hours = sum(weekly_hours_viewed, na.rm = TRUE),\n            total_weeks = n_distinct(week)) %>%\n  arrange(desc(total_hours)) %>%\n  slice(1:5)\n\n```\n\n## Press Release 3: Netflix’s Global Non-English TV Success\n\n### From Seoul to Madrid: Non-English Originals Reshape Netflix’s Global Top 10\n\nNetflix today announced the remarkable worldwide success of its Non-English language TV series, which continue to capture audiences and fuel subscriber growth around the globe.\n\nAcross all markets, Non-English TV titles have generated more than **`r scales::comma(non_eng_hours)` hours of global viewing**, cementing their role as a cornerstone of Netflix’s content strategy.
